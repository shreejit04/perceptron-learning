# perceptron-learning

Considering the training set (gzipped) on 1024 dimensions.
1. Train a Boolean linear classifier (using the Perceptron algorithm) on the training set.

The code outputs a classifier set (as a real-valued normal vector for the line separator).
Uses the same format as a single row in the training file (without the label).
The margin parameter achieved by the linear classifier on the training sample.

The code was completed without using built-in functions from ML packages, and only raw python code.
